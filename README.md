# Photo Utilities

Small helpers I've written for myself as a photographer.

## Organize Photos

Moves all files of specified types from one directory to an organized file structure based on file create date. In the past and the future this will be primarily based on EXIF data. For help on the tool's API, see:

    python3 organize_photos.py -h

This was primarily created to replicate functionality of lightroom I no longer wished to pay for.
